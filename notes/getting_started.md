# Getting Started


## Goals

1. new name?
    a.
2. should draft out outline of how we want to create the objects to combine
all the packages and work with `plotnine` (probably most important + most fun?)
3. we'll want to be rigorous with the naming of everything
4. Potentially could work on developing the capacity to do inserts like done in `cowplot`. this shouldn't be too hard (but going to deal with some svg structure...)

## Thoughts on `.svg` implimentation

1. time cost (is it too much? - see proof of concept example -- the for-loop). Could this argue for a png version as well except if not creating raster images?
2. svg code has a larger potential to being hacked (can technically inject javascript code in it like a html document). If one doesn't save the file as svg that isn't a problem, but is it dangerous we are working directly with svg objects? I don't think so - but I think we should remember this danger (maybe with CI/CD implementation if we ever test other peoples code...)
